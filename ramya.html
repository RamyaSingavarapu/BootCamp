    <p><b>Java </b> is a high-level, class-based,<a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a> language
        that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
        language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can
        run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically
        compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
        architecture.</p>

    <p><b>Python</b> is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
        emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
        object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
        projects.[28]</p>
