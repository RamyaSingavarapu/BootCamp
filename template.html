    <p>A hair dryer, hairdryer[1] or blow dryer is an <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics">electromechanical</a> device that blows ambient or hot
        air over damp
        hair to speed the evaporation of water to dry the hair. Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and
        style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand.
        These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving
        products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the
        hair.


        The normal use of a hair dryer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HairstyleHairstyles">Hair Styles</a>using blow dryers usually have volume
        and discipline, which can be further improved with styling
        products, hairbrushes, and combs during drying to add tension, hold and lift.

        Blow dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first, stationary, model was created by Alexander F.
        Godefroy in his salon in France. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared in 1920. Blow dryers are used
        in beauty salons by professional stylists and in the household by consumers.

    <h2>Hair Dryer Maintenance and Safety</h2>
    <p>
        Hair dryer manufacturers devote a considerable amount of their time and resources to the safety features of
        their product. They design their hair dryers to be safe in the largest variety of conditions, and this is why a
        lot of hair dryers come with features such as front grills, protective screens, insulation, a thermal fuse,
        bimetallic strip, and safety cut-off switch. However, you still need to be mindful of how you use your hair
        dryer and you need to make an effort to maintain it properly.
